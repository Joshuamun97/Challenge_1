# # <Challenge 1>

## Description

In this project, we were to replace any non semantic elements with semantic elements. This is to allow for a better flow within both the html and css. This creates better structure within both. This is also for accessibility reasons. For any screen readers, instead of reading out div it will read out more specific sections of the page. I learned that there are multiple tag options out there that can really clean up your code and make it your own.
